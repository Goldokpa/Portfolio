# Adding Your Profile Picture

To add your profile picture to the About page:

1. Save the image you shared as `profile.jpg` in this directory (`public/images/`)
2. The image will automatically be displayed on the About page

Note: Make sure the image is named exactly `profile.jpg` for it to be properly displayed.
